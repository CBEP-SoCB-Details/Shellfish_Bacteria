# Data Sources
We accessed publically available data on bacteria levels in Maine coastal waters
from the web site of Maine DMR.  These public data sets provide a synopsis of
recent observations of bacteria levels, usually from the most recent 30
observations collected from any particular location.  The summary data includes
median and 90th percentiles of those most recent observations.  These summary
values relate directly to Maine and NSSP safety standards.  The most recent 30
observations typically are collected over several years.


## Public "P90" Data

### 2018 P90 Data**
* URL: https://dmr-maine.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/mainedmr-public-health-2018-p90-scores/data
* Nominal Date: 9/30/2019
* "Last updated": 2 months ago
* Date Accessed: November 25th, 2019
* Accessed by: Tyler Walsh

As of November 25th, 2019,  spreadsheet, KML, and shapefiles of the full 2018
P90 data set were downloaded by clicking on the "Download" button on the top
right of the "Data" tab (it appears this can also be accessed on the "Overview"
tab as well).

### Older P90 Data
P90 datasets prior to 2018 could not be accessed, but as the data sets overlap,
the "p90" and median scores from successive years are not independent anyway.

Aparent links to similar data from Years 2017 and 2016 appeared here:
https://dmr-maine.opendata.arcgis.com/search?q=p90 (or can be accessed by 
editing the URL for the 2018 data in the obvious way):

2017 P90 Data URL: https://dmr-maine.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/mainedmr-public-health-2017-p90-scores

2016 P90 Data URL: https://dmr-maine.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/mainedmr-public-health-2016-p90-scores

But clicking on the 'Download" tabs had inconsistent effects.

## Raw Data
We requested data from DMR via e-mail.  Curtis C. Bohlen received an E-mail 
from Benjamin Wahle of DMR on November 26, 2019, containing the following 
three files:

*  "2016 p90 for CBEP.xlsx"  
*  "2017 p90 for CBEP.xlsx"  
*  "p90_16.lpkx" (a GIS "Layer File")

Curtis C. Bohlen recieved one further e-mail From Wahle on November 27 
containing the following file:  
*  "Casco Bay WQ 15 19.csv"  
Curtis C. Bohlen received another e-mail December 6 from Wahle, containing
useful metadata:  
*  "Geomean and P90 Explanation.docx"
