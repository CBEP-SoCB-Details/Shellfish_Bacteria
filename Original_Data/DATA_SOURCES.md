As of November 25th, 2019 spreadsheet, KML, and shapefiles of the full 2018 P90 data set 
were downloaded by clicking on the "Download" button on the top right of the "Data" tab
(it appears this can also be accessed on the "Overview" tab as well).

P90 datasets prior to 2018 could not be accessed.  Years 2017 and 2016 appear here:
https://dmr-maine.opendata.arcgis.com/search?q=p90 (or can be accessed by edioting the URL for the 2018 data in the obvious way) 
2017 P90 Data URL: https://dmr-maine.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/mainedmr-public-health-2017-p90-scores
2016 P90 Data URL: https://dmr-maine.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/mainedmr-public-health-2016-p90-scores
But clicking on the 'Download" tabs had inconsistent effects, suggesting there was a server malfunction occurring.

We requested data from DMR via e-mail.  Curtis C. Bohlen received an E-mail from Benjamin Wahle of DMR on November 26, 2019, containing the following three files:

Curtis C. Bohlen received another e-mail December 6 from Wahle, containing useful metadata:
