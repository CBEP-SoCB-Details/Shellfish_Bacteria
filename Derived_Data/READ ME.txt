After merging the three p90 data files and cleaning up inconsistencies, I get the following data columns across all three years.  My interpretation of data columns in parentheses, when I have one.

"Station" (Station Code -- related to GIS data by lat long, and for 2018 data, by x and y in UTM)
"Class" (Approved, Conditionally Approved, Restricted, Conditionally Restricted or Prohibited)
"Count" (Number of Samples. ordinarily 30, sometimes less because data files calculate stats on "Most recent 30")
"MFCount" (Some times lower that Count. Why? Which number actually represents the number of samples included in calculations?)
"GM" (Geometric Mean)
"SDV" (Some sort of a standard deviation? Is this SD of raw (untransformed) data, SD of log data, or something else?) 
"MAX" (Maximum Observed Value)
"P90" (90th percentile)
"Appd_Std" (Standard for a station to be in "approved" condition. Almost always 31)
"Restr_Std" (Standard for a station to be in "restricted" condition. Almost always 163)
"Lat_DD" (Latitude. Is this in WGS84 or some other datum / coordinate system?)
"Long_DD" (Longitude. Is this in WGS84 or some other datum / coordinate system?
"Grow_Area" (Code for management areas for classification and closure decisions).

GIS data were assemble from the p90 data, which included lats and longs.  Data was read into ArcGIS as a CSV table, and saved as a shapefiles.  Locations were selecte that were within 500 m of the Casco BAy waterhsed layer, which go al lsampling locations in our region.

Reviewing the data, however, amkes it prety clear the p90 data in subsequent years are not independent, so other than using the 2018 p90 ma, we wil lneed toanalyze underlying data to get meaningful trend analyses.
